# NeuronalConnectivity-Model
Modelling neuronal connectivity with multivariate probability distributions. Independent project work as part of a graduate course at KTH in Stockholm.

In this project, connectivity structures of neuronal networks that arise from varying cell morphologies were studied. For this intent, suitable representations of neuronal shapes were constructed via multivariate probability distributions such as the skew-elliptical and Sinh-Arcsinh distributions. Network connectivity was represented as binary matrices which were able to reveal how the connectivity is altered with varied neuronal morphologies.
